## Suggested Topics (check attachment for relevant data and info)

### Proj01. Real estate price prediction [[link](./proj01-real-state-sale-price-prediction/)]
* Suggested analysis: 
    * Analyze the residental home prices in Ames, Iowa with the provided dataset, see if you could find any attributes that could impact the housing prices
    * Create a model to predict the housing sales price based on the given attributes
    * Evaluate your model, provide metrics on the model accuracy

### Proj02. Insurance cost prediction [[link](./proj02-insurance-cost-prediction/)]
* Suggested analysis:
    * Analyze the data on 1338 individuals' insurance cost and their corresponding personal information, see if there is any attributes that could impact individual's insurance cost
    * Create a model to predict the insurance cost based on the given attributes
    * Evaluate your model, provide metrics on the model accuracy

### Proj03. Soccer player database exploration [[link](./proj03-soccer-player-database/)]
* Suggested analysis
    * Analyze the data, see if you could find any attributes that are strongly impacting the players' potential and value
    * See if you could build a model to predict players' market value or potential
    * See if there is any common features among the top 50 players in market value

### Proj04. 2016 primary data [[link](./proj04-2016-primary/)]
* Suggested analysis
    * Analyze the 2016 Democratic/Republican primary voting result, profile the counties/states/regions where Trump and Clinton won, see if you could find any pattern or clue.
    * See if you could build a model to help explain pattern you observed

### Proj05. COVID-19 data analysis [[link](./proj05-covid19/)]
This is more of an open question
* Suggested analysis
    * Check the general trend of COVID case numbers over time in US and the world
    * Profile the cases by demographic information like age, gender, race, region, etc. Check if there is any skewness in the case distribution on certain profiles.
    * Visualization on the insights you extracted from the data
* Suggested dataset
    * Case stats by country and time: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data
    * City of Chicago data on cases, deaths, and hospitalizations: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-daily-cases-deaths-and-hospitalizations
    * CDC covid data tracker: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/
