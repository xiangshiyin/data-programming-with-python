# Local coding tools

## Make Python available
### `Anaconda` (**suggested**)
Install the well packaged Python toolset to your local computer
* Please download Anaconda via this link: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution. You can download link when you scroll to the bottom of the web page. Please choose the installer that's compatible to your computer operation system
  * For Mac OS user, you can download `64-Bit Graphical Installer (591 MB)`
  * For windows user with a 64-bit operation system, you can download `64-Bit Graphical Installer (594 MB)`
  * For Windows user with a 32-bit operation system, you can download `32-Bit Graphical Installer (488 MB)`

### `Miniconda + Poetry` (the "fancy" way if you wanted additional challenges)
* Follow the instruction [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/main/miniconda.html) to install `Miniconda`
* Install and use `poetry` to manage your python dependencies
  * About `poetry`: https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#project-setup
  * Install `poetry` following the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
  * If you just want to install the listed dependencies in `poetry.lock`, you can run command `poetry install --no-root` [[*reference*](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#installing-dependencies-only)]
  * To activate the default virtualenv, run command `poetry shell` [[*reference*](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#activating-the-virtual-environment)]

## Code Editor
### `Jupyter Notebook`
This will be **our primary way to practice Python coding in this class**, more information can be found [here](https://jupyter.org/). As can be seen from the official website of `Jupyter`, you could choose either `Jupyter Notebook` or `JupyterLab` as your coding tool. We will be primarily using `Jupyter Notebook`.
### `Visual Studio Code`
You can download and install visual studio code (`vscode`) follow the link https://code.visualstudio.com/

# Online coding tools
## `replit`
Please head to https://replit.com, sign up a free account, and log in the account. They provide a free in-browser coding environment for 50+ programming languages including Python. Depending on our internet connections in the school campus, we will see if this could an option. 

## `Google Colab` (notebook)
* For general information on Google Colab, check https://colab.research.google.com/
* You can execute the notebook code samples under each lecture folder posted via the ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) button listed to run the notebook on Google Colab in your browser (you may need to have a google account in order to use Google Colab)
* You can also directly open Google Colab notebooks and write code

## `Github Codespace`
* Github now also provides a free codespace to run the whole code repository (including the notebook code samples) in your browser. Check [here](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for more information.
