# Lecture 08: Time Series Operations and Basic Visualizations

## Topics
Here are the topics we are going to cover
* [ ] Basic data types supported in the `datetime` library
  | Type      | Description                                                                     |

  | date      | Store calendar date (year, month, day) using the Gregorian calendar             |
  | time      | Store time of day as hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds                  |
  | datetime  | Store both date and time                                                        |
  | timedelta | The difference between two datetime values (as days, seconds, and microseconds) |
  | tzinfo    | Base type for storing time zone information                                     |
