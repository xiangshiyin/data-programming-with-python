# Lecture 10: Data Visualization and Regression Analysis

## Topics
Here are the topics we are going to cover
* [ ] TBD


## Concepts
* `seaborn` vs. `matplotlib` [[official doc](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction.html#relationship-to-matplotlib)]
  * `Seaborn`’s integration with `matplotlib` allows you to use it across the many environments that matplotlib supports, including exploratory analysis in notebooks, real-time interaction in GUI applications, and archival output in a number of raster and vector formats.
  * While you can be productive using only `seaborn` functions, full customization of your graphics will require some knowledge of `matplotlib`’s concepts and API. One aspect of the learning curve for new users of `seaborn` will be knowing when dropping down to the `matplotlib` layer is necessary to achieve a particular customization. On the other hand, users coming from `matplotlib` will find that much of their knowledge transfers.
  * `Matplotlib` has a comprehensive and powerful API; just about any attribute of the figure can be changed to your liking. A combination of `seaborn`’s high-level interface and `matplotlib`’s deep customizability will allow you both to quickly explore your data and to create graphics that can be tailored into a publication quality final product.
* Datasets `seaborn` can work with [[official doc](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/data_structure.html)]
